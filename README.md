**Note:** The code for this project is private and confidential. You can explore the live website and mobile apps for a better understanding of the platform's functionality.

Welcome to the Trails AI repository! This project is an extension of the Trails platform, designed to provide students with an AI-powered university assistant. Trails AI answers questions related to a specific university by pulling from official resources and integrates user experiences to provide more comprehensive responses.

Currently, Trails AI supports Penn State University, with plans to add more universities soon. Students can create personalized conversations, learn from their peers' experiences, and navigate campus resources effortlessly through the AI assistant.

## Overview

I have worked on Trails AI end to end, including both the mobile app and the website, with complete backend AI integration. The AI assistant is accessible on both iOS and Android, and there is also a dedicated web version of the AI assistant. Trails AI ensures that students receive accurate, timely, and user-informed answers to their questions.
